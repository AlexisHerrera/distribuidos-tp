# Client

## Requirements

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Use the `run-compose.sh` script to start all nodes, including the client.

```sh
./run-compose.sh [yes/no] [number]
```

`number` represents the percentage that the dataset will be shrinked
in case the `yes` is passed to use the small dataset

Example 1: run without flags is the same as running `python3 generate-compose.py` to generate `docker-compose.yaml`

```sh
./run-compose.sh
```

Example 2: run with `yes` uses small dataset, by default is 10% its equivalent to run `python3 generate-compose.py -s` to generate `docker-compose.yaml`

```sh
./run-compose.sh yes
```

Example 3: run with `yes` and specify percentage

```sh
./run-compose.sh yes 40
```

## EOF treatment

Best case scenario:

1. One node receives EOF for user `a` and becomes the leader, then it notifies other nodes.
2. Node `n` receives the notification from leader node.
3. Node `n` can be in different states:
   1. It is processing a message for user `a`.
      1. Finish processing the message and notify leader that the node is done.
   2. It is processing a message for other user, say `b`.
      1. It is assumed[^1] that the last message for user `a` has already been proceseed, so notify the leader that the node is done.
   3. It is not processing any message.[^1]
      1. Send the leader node that the node is done.

[^1] As messages are delivered in order, the last message before `EOF` for user `a` must have been delivered.

Worst case scenario:

1. One node receives EOF for user `a` and becomes the leader, then it notifies other nodes.
2. Node `n` receives the notification from leader node.
3. Node `n` can be in different states:
   1. It is processing a message for user `a` and fails (sends `nack`).
      1. If other node receives the message it must return `nack` until the message is back to the node `n`.
